# First-Year-Symposium
This project was apart of an assignment for the First-Year Symposium at TAMUCC.
Majority of the coding was done by my partner, while I provided the main concepts of how the game would work along with proof reading the code.
This project was made in 2021 and isn't as efficent as we could have made it due to time constraints.
